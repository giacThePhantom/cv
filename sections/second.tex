During my bachelor in Computer Science I gained experience in handling large dataset, solving algorithmic and machine-learning problems while prioritizing performance and maintainability.
I applied this skills in my bachelor thesis, where I developed a computational pipeline that utilized transcriptomic data to investigate how cancer-related mutations in untranlsated regions affect gene translation.
Continuing my studies in Quantitative and Computational Biology I applied my computational skills to the biological domain, honing my proficiency in analyzing biological data using computational methods, making inferences to propose explanations or suggest additional experimental procedures.
My focus was centered on neuronal systems and their mathematical modelling, and I complete project involving computational simulation of neuronal biophysisc whenever feasible.
Currently, I am enagaged in an internship at CIMEC, where I am developing a computational model of the honeybee olfactory system to reveal neural correlates of sleep.
This internship has offered me the opportunity to explore large-scale neuronal models and fine-tune them to accurately replicate observed behavior.
